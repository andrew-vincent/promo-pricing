Detecting promotional pricing based on purchase orders

The goal of this project was to see if we could develop a method of detecting promotional prices from purchase order data.
I have included anonymized data that includes a true flag of promo pricing to compare against the methods we create.

The main file for this project in annotated and explains each step of the process.
